# Distribution


Terp Network is to belong to the people, not wealthy VC firms. This is why we decided not to do any private sales or investment rounds and rather self-fund the project to launch. The Foundation will perscribe a fair distribution of all genesis $TERP tokens without any remuneration in return. 

The Terp Foundation is to be a Legally Recognized DAO, & will be issuing these tokens. The foundation can fund development projects & other actions for the good of the community. 

Hard work has happened to find a design that is difficult to game and fairly distirbuted amount actual participants and look forward to encouraging a vibrant & active community around Terp-NET.

The development team fund is a fund that will be nessesary to reward those who put in the energy to bring this to lauch but will also leave some funds in reserve, controlled by the TERP Foundation. This will be a sub-DAO of Terp Network. 


Below is a draft of the tokenomics, note that this is not final and is succeptable to change at any time.


**At genesis, there will be 420,000,000 $TERP Tokens & 7,100,000 $PERSY Tokens** 

**At genesis, 10.5% of $PERSY tokens total supply is in circulation.**
 90% will be created as rewards to delegators & validators for staking $TERP. More details can be found [here.]()

#### **of these tokens, we will distribute them as follows (note these are % based, from initial circulating supply):**

## $TERP
- 22% Foundation
- 28% Airdrops
- 50% Community Treasury

## $PERSY
- 5% Test Network Bounty 
- 2.5% CGAS Holders
- 2.5% Cannabis + Web-3 project holders


Yes, half of $TERP tokens supply is controlled by community governance, & almost 30% of tokens will be fair-dropped on Cannabis & Web-3 believers.

Please note that most of these tokens will be subject to a vesting period to limit initial liquidity & avoid quick dumping. The foundation will have around 25% of their token supply liquid on day one, so they can help establish the LP pools. But all the rest of the genesis tokens will be vested on various schedules. 

## Future Minting

Many protocols mint more tokens over time to be able to pay for ongoing development, marketing or to provide inventives to LPs or stakers. However, there needs to be clear limits to growth of the token supply, and ideally, the inflation rate should decrease overtime. We have decided to follow the mechanics set by $OSMO distribution mechanics of cutting the emission & distribution of $PERSY tokens by 1/3rd every year.

**Minting is controlled by the protocol & can be changed via governance.**

We also do not prescribe where the tokens go but let the Test-NET DAO decide on the distribution of these tokens based on the future needs of the chain. Do we need more marketing or dev? Do we want to mint fewer this year with the potential to use them next year? Based on the changing market and environment, this is up to the DAO to decide.
